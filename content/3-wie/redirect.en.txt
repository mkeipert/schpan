Text: 

Emotions move us to enjoy life intensely and generally arise when people feel valued and involved: in their own personal environment, by people who mean something to them, but also by brands and products. The goal of Schillinger & Pankratz is to bring people and brands together to evoke such emotions.  Through the personal involvement of the recipient, communication is not a one way street but rather interaction. We are convinced that corporate communication is only successful communication when consumers, customers or business partners are allowed and able to respond.

Since we need to have fundamental knowledge of how and when emotions arise, we focus on those areas of life where emotions are often at play. This is particularly the case in sport and culture. Thus, we know exactly which mechanisms work and how we can best bring together people and brands.

In this sense, we understand ourselves as managers of interaction and promoters of emotions!
